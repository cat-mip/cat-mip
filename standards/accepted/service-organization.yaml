definition: |
  A Service Organization is a hierarchical container used within on-premises N-central
  deployments to group and manage multiple customer environments under a single Partner (MSP
  or IT Pro). It acts as an intermediary layer between the Partner and the Customer (Tenant)
  and allows for administrative separation, reporting, and delegation of services across
  logically distinct client accounts. Service Organizations are primarily used for internal
  structuring of accounts, enabling MSPs to manage multiple customers without cross-
  contamination of access or policy.
