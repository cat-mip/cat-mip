  A Patch is a specific update package intended to correct known issues, fix
  vulnerabilities, or improve functionality in existing software. Patches may be distributed
  by vendors as part of regular update cycles (e.g., Microsoft Patch Tuesday), or released
  ad hoc in response to critical security flaws. In the MSP context, patches are applied
  across multiple tenants, devices, or sites using automation policies, schedules, or manual
  triggers.
