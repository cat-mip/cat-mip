  A Policy is a defined set of rules or configurations that govern how systems, devices,
  users, or services should behave or be managed within an environment. Policies enforce
  standards related to security, compliance, automation, performance, and access. In MSP and
  IT operations, policies are applied to endpoints, users, or sites to ensure consistent
  behavior, streamline operations, and meet organizational or regulatory requirements.
