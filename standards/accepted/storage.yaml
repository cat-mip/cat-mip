  Storage refers to the physical or virtual infrastructure used to persist data, including
  backups, logs, software, configurations, and operating system files. In the MSP and vendor
  context, storage may include local disk drives, network-attached storage (NAS), cloud
  storage services (e.g., AWS S3 buckets), or specialized backup storage vaults. Storage is a
  critical resource that supports data retention, recovery, and compliance.
