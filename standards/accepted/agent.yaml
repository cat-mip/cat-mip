definition: 'An Agent is a lightweight software component installed on a managed Device (Asset) that enables remote monitoring, management, automation, and communication with company or integrated systems. Agents collect telemetry, enforce policies, run scripts, initiate backups, and trigger alerts based on configured logic. In the MSP context, agents are essential for endpoint visibility, proactive issue resolution, and executing AI-assisted or automated workflows.'
