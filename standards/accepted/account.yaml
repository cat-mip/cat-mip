  The term Account is discouraged due to its ambiguity. It can refer to multiple different
  roles in the ecosystem, including: a Tenant (a customer managed by an MSP), an MSP (a
  partner), a Distributor Customer (a client of a distributor), or a Billing Entity (used in
  financial systems). Because of this ambiguity, using 'Account' in prompts or documentation
  can cause confusion or incorrect agent actions.

agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When "Account" is used in a prompt, the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Attempt to infer the intended object (Tenant, MSP, Customer, etc.)'
    - 'If inference succeeds, resolve the term to the correct object type and execute accordingly'
    - Prompt for clarification if multiple interpretations are possible
    - This behavior increases the risk of misinterpretation and is not recommended
