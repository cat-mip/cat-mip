definition: |
  Traffic refers to the flow of data packets transmitted across a network between devices,
  services, or endpoints. It includes both inbound and outbound communication and can
  represent various protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SSH) and applications. In MSP and IT
  operations, monitoring traffic is essential for performance analysis, bandwidth
  management, anomaly detection, and security threat identification.

  - Packet Stream
  - Throughput
relationships:
  - 'Traffic influences Bandwidth, Latency, or QoS'
  - 'Traffic isMonitoredBy Firewall, NetworkProbe, or AI Agent'
  - Traffic isSentTo DestinationDevice or ExternalService
  - Traffic mayBeClassifiedAs Normal or Suspicious
  - Traffic mayTrigger Alert or PolicyAction
  - Traffic originatesFrom SourceDevice or Endpoint
prompt_examples:
  - Analyze outbound traffic from the finance VLAN over the past 24 hours.
  - Block all traffic to known malicious IPs using the firewall policy.
  - Detect unusual traffic spikes to external DNS servers.
  - Summarize HTTP traffic patterns by device for the last 7 days.
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to "Traffic," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Aggregate or filter traffic by protocol, source, destination, port, or time window'
    - Correlate traffic patterns with known risks or baseline behaviors
    - |
      Detect anomalies or threshold violations such as unusual spikes or unauthorized
      destinations
    - 'Query network flow data, packet captures, or traffic logs from monitoring tools'
    - |
      Trigger appropriate actions such as alerting, blocking, throttling, or logging based on
      configured policies
