  A Webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback that automatically sends real-time data or event
  notifications from one system to another when a specified condition is met. Unlike APIs
  that require polling, webhooks push information immediately to an external endpoint. In
  MSP and IT environments, webhooks are often used to trigger workflows, sync systems, log
  events, or alert technicians based on changes in tickets, devices, backups, or policies.
