definition: |
  The top-level platform node representing vendor as the vendor and service provider. This
  is a unique, singular entity in the model. It serves as the source of platform-wide
  policies, agent frameworks, product definitions, and integration standards. All tenants,
  services, and tools exist beneath or are associated with this node.

agent_execution:
  interpretation: |
    When the term "vendor" is used in a prompt, the agent interprets it as a query against
    global or platform-wide definitions that originate from the vendor platform node. The
    agent resolves requests by
  actions:
    - 'Accessing the centralized vendor catalog of tools, templates, and product definitions'
    - Filtering results not tied to any specific tenant or MSP configuration
    - 'Providing vendor-wide metadata rather than tenant-specific data'
    - 'Returning default (global) policies, tools, scripts, or documentation'
