definition: |
  A Notification is a message or alert generated by a system, policy, or agent to inform a
  user, technician, or administrator of an event, condition, or required action.
  Notifications may be triggered by monitoring thresholds, policy violations, automation
  results, or system events. They can be delivered through various channels such as email,
  SMS, in-app alerts, or PSA integrations.
