definition: |
  An Integration is a defined connection between an external vendor's product or service and
  one or more vendor products. Integrations allow data exchange, automation, event handling,
  and workflow coordination across systems. They may be developed by vendor, by the external
  vendor, or by a partner, and can vary in complexity from simple scripts and API calls to
  deeply embedded multi-function toolsets.
