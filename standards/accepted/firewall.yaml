  A Firewall is a security system--either hardware-based, software-based, or a combination
  of both--that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on
  predetermined security rules. It serves as a barrier between trusted internal networks and
  untrusted external networks, such as the internet, to prevent unauthorized access and
  threats. In the DevOps Infrastructure Ontology, a firewall is categorized under network
  infrastructure components, emphasizing its role in network security management.
