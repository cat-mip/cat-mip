definition: |
  This term should probably be avoided due to ambiguity. An Organization is a general-
  purpose container representing any structured business or entity within the vendor
  ecosystem. It may refer to a Distributor, MSP, Tenant, or even vendor itself, depending on
  context. "Organization" is primarily used in internal models, system hierarchies, or data
  structures to abstract the roles of different actors in the platform. In end-user
  contexts, the more specific terms (MSP, Tenant, etc.) are preferred.

  interpretation: |
    When a prompt refers to an "Organization," the agent interprets it as a flexible node in
    the hierarchy. The AI agent resolves the entity's role based on its metadata
  actions:
    - Classify as MSP if it delivers services
    - Classify as Tenant if it receives services
    - Classify as Distributor if it resells to others
    - Classify as  Vendor if it's at the top of the hierarchy with publishing rights
