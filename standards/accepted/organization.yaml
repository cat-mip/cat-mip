definition: 'This term should probably be avoided due to ambiguity. An Organization is a general-purpose container representing any structured business or entity within the vendor ecosystem. It may refer to a Distributor, MSP, Tenant, or even vendor itself, depending on context. "Organization" is primarily used in internal models, system hierarchies, or data structures to abstract the roles of different actors in the platform. In end-user contexts, the more specific terms (MSP, Tenant, etc.) are preferred.'

    - If it delivers services → MSP
    - If it receives services → Tenant
