  A Remote Browser is a virtualized or cloud-hosted web browser session that runs on a
  remote server rather than the local device. It allows users to interact with web content
  securely without exposing their endpoint or internal network. In MSP and security-focused
  environments, remote browsers are used for isolating risky web activity, protecting
  against zero-day threats, and enforcing browsing policies without compromising the local
  system.
