  A Script is a predefined, executable set of instructions used to automate actions on
  devices, services, or platforms. In the MSP context, scripts are widely used for tasks
  such as remediation, deployment, configuration, and monitoring. Scripts can be written in
  various languages (e.g., PowerShell, Bash, Python) and are executed manually, on a
  schedule, or as part of automation policies triggered by events or conditions.
