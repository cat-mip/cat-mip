definition: '(Use with specificity--prefer concrete terms like Log, Metric, Event, or Configuration when possible) Data refers to any structured or unstructured information collected, stored, or generated by vendor systems and integrated tools. This includes telemetry, logs, metrics, configuration records, alerts, ticket history, and external feeds. While "Data" is technically accurate, it is too broad for effective agent interaction. Prompts should specify the type of data required to ensure accurate retrieval or action.'
