  WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) is a Microsoft technology that provides a
  standardized interface for accessing and managing data about Windows-based systems. It
  allows scripts, agents, and monitoring tools to query system information such as hardware
  status, software inventory, services, processes, and configuration settings. In MSP
  environments, WMI is widely used for device discovery, performance monitoring, remote
  execution, and automation.
