  Shadow IT refers to the use of software, hardware, cloud services, or other technology
  solutions within an organization without formal approval, visibility, or oversight from
  the IT department. This includes unmanaged SaaS tools, personal devices, and unauthorized
  data storage or sharing platforms. In MSP and IT environments, shadow IT poses risks
  related to security, compliance, data loss, and operational inefficiencies.
