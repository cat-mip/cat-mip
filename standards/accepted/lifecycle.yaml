  A Lifecycle is the end-to-end sequence of stages that an asset, service, user, or process
  goes through--from creation or onboarding to retirement or decommissioning. Lifecycles
  help MSPs and IT professionals define, automate, and govern the expected progression of
  objects such as devices, tickets, users, backups, or software. Lifecycle stages typically
  include onboarding, active use, maintenance, and offboarding, with associated policies and
  triggers at each step.

prompt_examples:
  - Automatically archive tickets once they reach the 'Closed' lifecycle stage for 90 days.
  - 'Display all assets in the "End-of-Life" stage.'
  - Trigger offboarding automation when a user's lifecycle status changes to 'terminated'.
  - 'What is the current lifecycle stage of all laptops deployed last quarter?'
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to a "Lifecycle," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Determine if any transitions (e.g., from Active to Retired) are pending or triggered'
    - 'Execute applicable workflows (e.g., provisioning, patching, decommissioning)'
    - Identify the object type and its current lifecycle stage
    - |
      Log the lifecycle state and any related actions in the appropriate system (e.g., CMDB,
      Ticketing Platform)
    - 'Retrieve associated policies, rules, or automations linked to that stage'
