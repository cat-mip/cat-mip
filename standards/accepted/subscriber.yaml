  A Subscriber is an entity -- typically a user, client, tenant, or system -- that is
  actively enrolled in or assigned to a service, product, or data stream. Subscribers
  receive notifications, updates, access, or resources according to their subscription level
  or role. In MSP and IT environments, subscribers are often associated with licensing,
  usage metrics, automation triggers, or event-driven integrations.
