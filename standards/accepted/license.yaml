definition: 'A License is a contractual or system-enforced right to use a product, service, or feature within defined terms (e.g., time, scope, seats, capabilities). In the MSP and vendor context, licenses are required for using specific vendor products (e.g., N-central, Cove) or features (e.g., Take Control, advanced reporting). Licenses may apply at the tenant, device, or user level and are tracked to ensure compliance, billing accuracy, and feature access.'
