  CLI (Command-Line Interface) is a text-based interface that allows users or systems to
  interact with software, operating systems, or devices by typing commands. The CLI provides
  direct access to system functions, configuration, and diagnostics without a graphical user
  interface. In MSP and IT environments, CLI tools are widely used for scripting,
  automation, remote troubleshooting, and advanced configuration.
