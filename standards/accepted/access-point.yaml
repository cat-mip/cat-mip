  An Access Point is a physcial network device that allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a
  wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless standards. It acts as a bridge between
  wireless clients and the wired infrastructure, managing traffic, authentication, and radio
  frequency (RF) coverage.  In MSP and enterprise IT environments, 
  access points are deployed indoors or outdoors and may include ruggedized industrial models. They manage wireless client connectivity,
  authentication, RF coverage, and traffic flow, and may also support IoT connectivity protocols such as Bluetooth and Zigbee.

prompt_examples:
  - Configure SSID and VLAN tagging on all indoor access points.
  - List all access points at the Denver office and their client count.
  - Restart the rooftop access point remotely due to packet loss reports.
  - 'Which access points are using outdated firmware?'
  - Locate the access point in the inventory or network topology
  - Log all actions related to access point configuration and status for auditing
  - 'Retrieve and report configuration, client associations, and health metrics'
  
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to an "Access Point," the AI agent will interpret it as a physical WLAN hardware device that provides wireless connectivity to the wired network.'
  actions:
    - Identify the access point in inventory or network topology.
    - Retrieve configuration, firmware version, and operational status.
    - Retrieve associated wireless clients and connection metrics.
    - Assess signal strength, channel utilization, interference, and throughput.
    - Check compliance with defined wireless security and configuration policies.
    - Surface performance or connectivity anomalies.
    - Recommend corrective actions such as channel tuning, power adjustment, SSID changes, or firmware updates.
    - Log all configuration and status changes for audit and troubleshooting purposes.
