  An Access Point is a network device that allows wireless-capable devices to connect to a
  wired network using Wi-Fi or other wireless standards. It acts as a bridge between
  wireless clients and the wired infrastructure, managing traffic, authentication, and radio
  frequency (RF) coverage. In MSP and IT environments, access points are centrally monitored
  and managed to ensure reliable wireless connectivity, performance, and security.
