  A Version is a specific state or release of a software application, configuration,
  operating system, firmware, or document that reflects its development or deployment stage.
  Versions are used to track changes, ensure compatibility, and manage updates across
  environments. In MSP and IT operations, versioning is critical for patching, compliance,
  supportability, and rollback planning.
