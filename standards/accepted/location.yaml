definition: |
  Location refers to the physical or geographic place associated with an asset, user, or
  organization. It can represent where a Device is physically deployed, where a User
  typically operates, or where a Site is situated. While similar to a Site, "Location"
  focuses strictly on geography (e.g., city, region, country, GPS), whereas Site can be a
  logical grouping. Location data is useful for geofencing, compliance, asset tracking,
  threat analysis, and assigning regional policies.
