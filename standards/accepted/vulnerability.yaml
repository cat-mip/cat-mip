  A Vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in software, hardware, or configuration that could
  be exploited to compromise system security, data integrity, or availability.
  Vulnerabilities are typically assigned a unique identifier (e.g., CVE ID), a severity
  score (e.g., CVSS), and may be associated with known exploits. In the MSP context,
  vulnerabilities are detected through scans, threat intelligence feeds, or vendor
  advisories and are often tracked and mitigated using patching, configuration changes, or
  compensating controls.
