definition: 'A Network Map is a visual or structured representation of devices, endpoints, and interconnections within a networked environment. It provides topology awareness, showing how elements such as routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and workstations are linked--often including metadata like IP addresses, MAC addresses, status, and roles. Network maps support monitoring, diagnostics, capacity planning, and security audits.'

prompt_examples:
  - Export the network map with IP and MAC address details for compliance reporting.
  - Highlight all unmanaged devices on the current network map.
  - Regenerate the network map after onboarding new switches.

agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to a "Network Map," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Identify gaps, unmanaged assets, or policy violations'
    - Organize devices and connections into a logical or physical layout
    - 'Overlay relevant metrics (e.g., status, alert state, bandwidth) if requested'
    - 'Present the map visually (if supported), or provide a structured summary as output'
    - Retrieve or regenerate the latest topology data from discovery tools or agents
