definition: |
  A Backup is a secure, stored copy of data, system configuration, or application state,
  used to restore functionality or recover from data loss, corruption, or disaster. In the
  MSP context, backups may be scheduled, continuous, or event-triggered, and can target
  endpoints, servers, cloud services (e.g., Microsoft 365), or databases. Backup policies
  define the scope, frequency, retention, and storage destination of backup operations.
