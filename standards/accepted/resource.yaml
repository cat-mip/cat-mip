  A Resource is a general term that refers to any manageable object within the vendor
  ecosystem. This includes physical or virtual components such as devices, users, software,
  network elements, storage, and compute instances. In internal models (and in the DevOps
  Infrastructure Ontology), "Resource" is often used as an abstract class or grouping term
  for things that can be monitored, configured, automated, or queried. It is not recommended
  for use in AI prompts due to its vagueness.
