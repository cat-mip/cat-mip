  API (Application Programming Interface) is a defined set of protocols and methods that
  allows software systems to communicate with each other. APIs expose functions, data, or
  services that can be accessed programmatically, enabling integration, automation, and
  extensibility across platforms. In MSP and IT environments, APIs are used for retrieving
  data, triggering actions, synchronizing systems, and building custom workflows.

    - Identify the correct API endpoint and required authentication method
    - 'Log the API interaction for tracking, troubleshooting, or auditing'
    - Parse the response data and handle errors or exceptions

      Take follow-up actions based on the API response, such as updating records or triggering
      alerts
