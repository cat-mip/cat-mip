definition: 'An Audit Log is a chronological record of system-generated entries that capture actions, events, or changes performed within a platform, application, or network. Each log entry typically includes a timestamp, actor (user or system), action type, and target object. Audit logs are used for accountability, traceability, compliance, security investigations, and operational transparency.'
