  PII (Personally Identifiable Information) refers to any data that can be used to identify
  an individual, either on its own or when combined with other information. This includes
  names, email addresses, phone numbers, government IDs, financial data, and biometric
  records. In MSP and IT environments, PII must be handled with strict security and
  compliance controls to meet privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.
