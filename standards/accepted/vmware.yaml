  VMware is a widely used virtualization and cloud infrastructure platform that enables the
  creation, management, and operation of virtual machines (VMs) and virtualized
  environments. VMware products support server, desktop, and network virtualization,
  allowing multiple workloads to run on shared physical hardware. In MSP and IT
  environments, VMware is often integrated for infrastructure management, backup,
  monitoring, and automation.
