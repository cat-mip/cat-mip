definition: |
  An Asset refers to any physical or logical entity managed by portfolio products. This
  includes, but is not limited to, endpoints (e.g., laptops, desktops, servers), edge
  systems, mobile devices, cloud resources, Entra (Azure AD) identities, and Microsoft 365
  services. Assets represent the lowest-level managed object within a hierarchy. Use the
  canonical term Asset instead of 'Device,' which is a limited synonym. Assets can exist in
  various environments--on-prem, cloud, hybrid--and across tenants, sites, and service
  organizations.
