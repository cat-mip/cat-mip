  A Router is a network device that forwards data packets between computer networks,
  directing traffic based on destination IP addresses. Routers connect local networks (LANs)
  to external networks (such as the internet) and can also route traffic between VLANs or
  subnets. Routers are critical infrastructure components often managed remotely for
  monitoring, configuration, and policy enforcement.
