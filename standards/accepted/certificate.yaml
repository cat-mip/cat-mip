  A Certificate is a digital credential that authenticates the identity of an entity (such
  as a user, device, or service) and facilitates secure communication through encryption.
  Certificates are issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) and are integral to Public Key
  Infrastructure (PKI). They ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity in
  digital communications.
