  An AI Agent is a software-based autonomous entity that interprets natural language prompts
  and executes multistep reasoning and actions using defined tools, APIs, and structured
  knowledge. AI Agents interact with the platform, devices, users, and other systems to
  perform tasks such as triage, reporting, automation, or decision support. AI Agents can
  chain tools, call scripts, and escalate issues, often acting on behalf of a technician or
  service provider.
