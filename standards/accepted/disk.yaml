definition: |
  A Disk is a physical or virtual storage component used by a device to persist data. Disks
  can be hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), or virtual volumes (e.g., VHDs in
  cloud environments). Disk information is collected for monitoring storage capacity,
  performance, health, and lifecycle. Disks may be local (installed on a device) or network-
  attached, and are critical for system stability and application functionality.

prompt_examples:
  - 'Alert me when any disk has less than 10% free space.'
  - Check disk usage on all servers in the 'Legal' tenant.
  - List all devices with SSDs larger than 512GB.
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to a "Disk," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - Differentiate between physical disks and logical partitions/volumes
    - 'Monitor for thresholds (e.g., low space, high I/O wait times)'
    - 'Report on total capacity, free space, used percentage, and disk type'
    - Retrieve storage information from device telemetry or system APIs
    - Trigger alerts or automated cleanup scripts as needed
