  A Workflow is a structured sequence of tasks or activities designed to accomplish a
  specific objective within a system or process. In the DevOps Infrastructure Ontology, a
  workflow represents the orchestration of actions, often automated, that manage and control
  various aspects of IT infrastructure and software development. Workflows are essential for
  ensuring consistency, efficiency, and repeatability in operations.
