  A Warranty refers to the contractual period during which a hardware asset (e.g., server,
  laptop, disk) is covered for repairs, replacements, or support by the manufacturer or
  vendor. In the MSP context, warranty information helps inform lifecycle management, asset
  planning, and service prioritization. Tracking warranty status enables technicians to
  escalate hardware issues appropriately and manage risk around unsupported devices.
