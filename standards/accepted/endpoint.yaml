  An Endpoint is any device that connects to a network and communicates with other systems,
  services, or users. Common endpoints include laptops, desktops, servers, mobile devices,
  and virtual machines. In MSP and IT environments, endpoints are managed assets that may be
  monitored, secured, patched, and inventoried. Endpoints are often the target of policies,
  automation, alerts, and security controls.
