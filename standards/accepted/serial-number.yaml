  A Serial Number is a unique identifier assigned to a specific hardware or software asset
  by the manufacturer or vendor. It is used to distinguish one physical or virtual item from
  another for purposes such as inventory tracking, warranty management, licensing, and
  support. In MSP and IT environments, serial numbers are commonly used to manage devices
  like laptops, servers, network hardware, and backup appliances.
