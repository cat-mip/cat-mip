definition: |
  A Customer is an organization or individual that receives IT services from an MSP. In
  technical terms, this is represented as a Tenant -- a logically isolated environment
  within an MSP's management system. Each Tenant contains its own devices, users, policies,
  and configuration, and does not have visibility into other tenants. "Customer" is the
  business-facing term; "Tenant" is the system-facing canonical term.

    When the prompt includes "Customer," the agent maps this to a Tenant object in the system.
    It will
  actions:
    - Enforce data and action boundaries so one tenant cannot affect another
    - Resolve the correct tenant based on name or ID
    - 'Retrieve or apply policies, scripts, or configurations owned by the MSP'
    - Scope queries or actions to that tenant's isolated environment
