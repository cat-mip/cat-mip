  SSO (Single Sign-On) is an authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple
  systems or applications with a single set of login credentials. It streamlines user access
  while reducing password fatigue and improving security through centralized identity
  management. In MSP and IT environments, SSO is often integrated with identity providers
  (IdPs) such as Azure AD, Okta, or Google Workspace to control access across cloud and on-
  premises services.

  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to "SSO," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - Log successful or failed login attempts for auditing and security monitoring
    - 'Report on SSO usage, errors, and integration status across environments'
    - Retrieve SSO configuration details for the relevant identity provider and service
    - 'Trigger conditional access workflows based on role, location, or device compliance'
    - Validate user identity and access permissions through the SSO process
