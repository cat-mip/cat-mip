definition: |
  A File is a discrete unit of digital data stored on a device or in the cloud. Files can
  represent executables, documents, logs, scripts, configurations, or any other form of
  structured or unstructured content. In the vendor context, files may be transferred,
  monitored, scanned for threats, or used as part of automation workflows. Files exist
  within file systems, storage volumes, or cloud containers, and may be associated with
  software, devices, or users.
