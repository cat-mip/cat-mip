definition: |
  A Port is a logical or physical interface used for communication between devices or
  applications. In networking, a port refers to a numbered endpoint in the transport layer
  (TCP/UDP) that identifies specific processes or services on a device (e.g., port 22 for
  SSH, port 443 for HTTPS). In hardware, a port can also refer to a physical connection
  point on a switch, router, or server. In MSP and IT environments, ports are monitored,
  managed, and filtered for performance, availability, and security.

agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to a "Port," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - Determine whether the request refers to a logical network port or physical hardware port
    - 'Evaluate port activity against policies, known vulnerabilities, or usage patterns'
    - 'Log port-related actions, including scans, changes, or access attempts'
    - 'Scan, query, or retrieve configuration and status for the specified port'
    - Trigger alerts or remediations for suspicious or unauthorized port usage
