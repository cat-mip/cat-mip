definition: |
  An External Vendor is a third-party company that provides software, hardware, or services
  which integrate with vendor products. These vendors are typically integration partners and
  may offer functionality in areas such as security, backup, PSA (Professional Services
  Automation), billing, remote access, or threat detection. External Vendors participate in
  the vendor ecosystem by exposing APIs, actions, or event streams that can be called by or
  respond to AI Agents, scripts, and workflows.
