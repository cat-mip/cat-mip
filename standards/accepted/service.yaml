definition: |
  A Service is a functional capability delivered through software, infrastructure, or human
  operations. In the DevOps Infrastructure Ontology, a service may be a system-level process
  (e.g., a daemon or microservice), a cloud-hosted API, or a business-facing offering (e.g.,
  backup service, monitoring service). In the MSP context, services may be IT services
  provided to tenants (e.g., endpoint protection), or software-based services running on
  devices or in the cloud.
