  Credentials are a set of authentication details used to verify the identity of a user,
  device, or system when accessing resources, services, or data. Typically, credentials
  include usernames and passwords, but they may also involve tokens, API keys, certificates,
  or biometric factors. In MSP and IT environments, credentials are securely stored,
  managed, and used by agents or technicians to perform automated tasks, remote access, or
  integrations.
