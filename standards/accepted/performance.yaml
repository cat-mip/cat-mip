definition: |
  Performance refers to the operational efficiency and responsiveness of a system, device,
  or application. It is typically measured through metrics such as CPU usage, memory
  consumption, disk I/O, network throughput, and latency. In the MSP and vendor context,
  performance is used to assess the health of devices, detect bottlenecks, and determine
  whether systems are operating within acceptable thresholds.

    reason: 'Accepted into CAT-MIP registry'
synonyms:
  - 'Efficiency (too vague - avoid in prompts)'
  - 'Responsiveness (context-specific - use when referring to end-user experience)'
  - 'System Health (ambiguous - use when referring to overall status)'
relationships:
  - Performance affects UserExperience
  - Performance isMeasuredBy Metric
  - Performance isMonitoredBy Agent or MonitoringPolicy
  - Performance isReportedIn Dashboard or Report
  - Performance triggers Alert or Automation
prompt_examples:
  - 'Check the performance of device "ENG-LT-05" and flag any CPU or memory spikes.'
  - |
    Generate a performance report for all servers in the 'West Coast' site over the last 7
    days.
  - 'What performance metrics are being tracked for the tenant "SecureNet"?'
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to "Performance," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Detect anomalies or degradation (e.g., sustained high CPU, low available RAM)'
    - Evaluate current values against historical baselines and configured thresholds
    - Optionally summarize trends in reports or dashboards
    - |
      Recommend or trigger remediation actions (e.g., restart service, notify admin, scale
      resources)
    - |
      Retrieve relevant metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, disk activity, and network
      traffic
