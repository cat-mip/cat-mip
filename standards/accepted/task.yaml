  A Task is an individual, executable unit of work within a larger Workflow. Tasks perform
  discrete actions such as running a script, checking system status, applying a patch, or
  sending a notification. In the DevOps Infrastructure Ontology, a task is an atomic
  operation that contributes to the overall goal of a workflow or automation policy. Tasks
  may be triggered manually, scheduled, or invoked automatically based on conditions.
