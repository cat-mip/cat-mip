  Cloud refers to infrastructure, platforms, or services hosted in a remote, internet-
  accessible environment rather than on-premises. 'Cloud' is typically used to describe:
  cloud-native products (e.g., Cove, Cloud Commander); third-party integrations with public
  cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP); and the hosting location or operational model for
  managed assets, policies, or storage. Because the term is broad, it should be accompanied
  by a qualifier (e.g., Cloud Backup, Cloud Integration, Cloud Device) to ensure clarity.
