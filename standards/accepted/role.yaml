definition: |
  A Role is a predefined set of permissions, responsibilities, or access rights assigned to
  a user, system, or agent within an IT or MSP environment. Roles are used to control access
  to systems, features, or data based on job function or context. They enable policy
  enforcement, least-privilege access, and streamlined onboarding by grouping permissions
  into reusable access profiles.
