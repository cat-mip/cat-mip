  A Template is a reusable configuration object that defines a set of settings, rules, or
  characteristics to be applied to one or more assets, such as devices, scripts, users, or
  policies. Templates are commonly used to enforce consistency across environments and to
  streamline the deployment of standardized configurations. In vendor products, templates
  may be used for onboarding, automation, security settings, or monitoring configurations.
