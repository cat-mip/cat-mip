  An IP Address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a device or interface within a
  network, facilitating communication between devices. IP addresses can be either IPv4 or
  IPv6 and are essential for routing data packets across networks. In the DevOps
  Infrastructure Ontology, an IP address is considered a fundamental component of network
  infrastructure, associated with devices, services, and network segments.
