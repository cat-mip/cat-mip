  A MAC Address (Media Access Control Address) is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a
  network interface card (NIC) used for communication on a local network segment. It is
  typically represented as a 12-digit hexadecimal value separated by colons or dashes (e.g.,
  00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E). In MSP and IT operations, MAC addresses are used for device
  identification, inventory tracking, access control, and network diagnostics.
