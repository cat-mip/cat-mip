  A Browser is a client application used to access and interact with content and services on
  the World Wide Web. It renders web pages, processes scripts, and facilitates communication
  with remote servers using protocols such as HTTPS. In MSP and IT environments, browsers
  are used to access web-based portals, dashboards, APIs, and SaaS platforms. They may also
  be managed through policies for security, compliance, and performance.
