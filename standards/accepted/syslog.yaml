  Syslog is a standard protocol used to capture and transmit log or event messages from
  network devices, servers, applications, or operating systems to a central log management
  system. Syslog messages include structured or semi-structured data that describe system
  events, warnings, errors, or informational messages. Syslog is commonly used to centralize
  logs for auditing, monitoring, security incident detection, and compliance.

prompt_examples:
  - Filter syslog messages for SSH login failures on Linux servers.
  - 'Forward all syslog messages to the SIEM platform and apply geo-IP tagging.'
  - Show all syslog entries from firewalls in the last 12 hours.
  - 'What syslog events triggered critical alerts this week?'
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to "Syslog," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - Access the syslog data store or forwarding pipeline
    - 'Filter or correlate logs based on the prompt (e.g., keyword, device, severity)'
    - 'Parse and normalize syslog messages for timestamp, source, facility, and severity'
    - Record any action taken based on syslog analysis in an audit or incident log

      Surface relevant entries or summaries, and optionally initiate an action (e.g., alert,
      script execution, ticket creation)
