  A User is an individual or system identity that interacts with IT services, applications,
  or infrastructure. Each user is typically associated with a unique account and may be
  assigned roles, permissions, policies, or resources. In MSP and IT environments, users are
  managed through identity systems, directory services, or RMM platforms to control access,
  monitor activity, and enforce security.
