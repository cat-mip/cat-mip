  OID (Object Identifier) is a globally unique identifier used in SNMP (Simple Network
  Management Protocol) to represent a specific piece of data that can be queried or
  monitored on a managed device. OIDs follow a hierarchical dotted-decimal notation (e.g.,
  1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0) and correspond to specific metrics or attributes such as uptime, CPU
  usage, or interface status. In MSP and IT environments, OIDs are essential for polling
  devices and triggering alerts based on performance or health data.

  - OID represents Metric or Status
prompt_examples:
  - 'Map custom OIDs to human-readable labels in the monitoring dashboard.'
  - 'Poll OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0 for system uptime on all SNMP-enabled devices.'
  - Set a threshold alert for the CPU load OID on VMware hosts.
  - 'What is the OID for memory usage on Cisco routers?'
agent_execution:
  interpretation: 'When a prompt refers to an "OID," the AI agent will'
  actions:
    - 'Compare against thresholds if defined, and trigger alerts or actions'
    - 'Interpret the result based on expected data type (e.g., integer, string, gauge)'
    - 'Log the OID query, result, and any subsequent actions in the monitoring system'
    - Look up the OID in the device's MIB or internal catalog
    - Use SNMP to query the corresponding value from the target device
