  A Report is a structured output that presents data collected from systems, policies, or
  agents over a defined time period. Reports are used for analysis, auditing, compliance,
  customer communication, or internal performance tracking. In the MSP and vendor context,
  reports may include information on device health, backup status, patch compliance, license
  usage, or automation outcomes. Reports can be generated on demand or scheduled, and may be
  exported in formats such as PDF, CSV, or JSON.
