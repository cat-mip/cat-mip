  ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) is the total value of recurring revenue from subscriptions
  or service contracts normalized over a one-year period. It represents the predictable
  income that an MSP or SaaS business expects to receive annually from active customers. ARR
  is a key metric for evaluating long-term growth, customer retention, and business
  valuation.
