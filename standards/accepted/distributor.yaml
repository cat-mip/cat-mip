definition: |
  A Distributor is an organization authorized to resell vendor products and services.
  Distributors may operate under their own branding, manage multiple MSPs or sub-
  distributors, and may either directly support their downstream entities or rely on vendor
  for support. Distributors typically have visibility and limited control over the
  environments of their managed MSPs.
