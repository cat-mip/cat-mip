  An Incident is an unplanned event or disruption that affects the normal operation of a
  service, system, or asset and requires investigation, response, or resolution. Incidents
  can range from device failures and service outages to security breaches or policy
  violations. In MSP and IT environments, incidents are tracked through ticketing systems
  and are often subject to escalation paths, service-level agreements (SLAs), and post-
  resolution analysis.
